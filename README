Beandroid

To install the project simply clone the repository and import projects into Eclipse.

Application flow: 
The application starts in LoginActivity, where user credentails are verified. If user credentials are valid, he is dispatched to HomeActivity.


Notable mentions:
- All activities except LoginActivity are extending BeanstalkActivity abstract class, thus inheriting Action Bar and Options Menu handling. The class is also responsible for proper handling of Logout and Exit. 

- The layout for login activity has default account domain name, user name, and password temporarily hardcoded inside in order to ease the process of testing.

- The default credentials for the 3 different user types are as follows:
-- for Owner:
	account domain: bartosz-filipowicz
	user name: bartoszfilipowicz
	password: applicake10

-- for Admin: 
	account domain: bartosz-filipowicz
	user name: login
	password: password

-- for User:
	account domain: bartosz-filipowicz
	user name: user
	password: test	  

Tests:
The tests are located in Beanstalk Android Client Tests project. 
So far, the tests are covering:
- LoginActivityTests: testing if application is properly responding to valid and invalid credentials. (further explanation can be found in the tests file)
- TimezoneConverterTests: testing conversion between rails timezones (used by Beanstalk) and java timezones.
- XMLCreatorTests: testing creation of XMLs used in POST, PUT and DELETE requests to Beanstalk API
- XMLParserTests: testing xml parser used to parse data from XMLs received form Beanstalk API
- YamlTesting: testing custom simple yaml parser implemented in the application (Yaml is used only in API's Changeset model)
